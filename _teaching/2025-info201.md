I am currently a teaching assistant for Info 201: Foundations of Data Science. I have taught under Dr. Carson Miller-Rigoli. 

As a teaching assistant, I lead lab sections that teach the fundementals of RStudio (Basic operations, visualizations, dyplr, report making) and foundational data science principles.
