I was a teaching assisstant for Info 103: Social Media Automation and Ethics. I was an assisstant for 6 quarters, and taught under Professor Spencer Williams and Professor Kyle Thayer. 

For this course, I lead sections that taught basic python functions (variables, for loops, function making, basic data structures).
