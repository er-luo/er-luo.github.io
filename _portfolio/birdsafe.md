BirdSafe aimed to encourage more conscious window purchasing to prevent bird collision related deaths and injuries. 

As a UX Researcher and Designer, I worked collaboratively with my team to identify stakeholders, conceptualize interventions, design a prototype, designed a User Interview protocol, and updated our prototype according to user feedback. Our results were compiled in a 15 page report.
